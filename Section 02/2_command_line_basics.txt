Below are some helpful commands to use to navigate the command line/terminal in
your computer. If you are not familiar with it at this time, don't worry about
it at all. I'll discuss what it is in the videos if/when I use it. Instructions
are provided for both Windows and Mac/Linux.

There is a command line basics video in the beginning of the next section as
well but having these now might help in this development section. Again, I will
mention it in the videos if/when I use the terminal/command line or if I use any
commands associated with it. Just keep them handy for now.

Good luck and I hope you find these useful!

To launch the terminal in a Mac: Go to your applications/launchpad or spotlight
search and start typing term and the terminal will pop-up. You can click on it
to launch it.

To launch the command line in Windows: Go to your search bar and start type cmd 
and the command line app will pop up. Alternatively you can use the PowerShell
terminal by looking for that app instead.

To see which directory you are currently in:
Windows-> cd
