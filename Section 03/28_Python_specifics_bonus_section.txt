I intend to post some bonus Python specific content for the remainder of
section 3. This content does not apply to Algorithms and Data Structures that
we will explore in sections 4 and 5 but will be good coding practice since it
relates to the Python programming language and will be good to know for coding
interviews. I have so far added the following topics:

1) Lambda expressions
2) Generators - under the hood (how they work)
3) Create your own generators using yield

I will update this lecture as I add more content and exercises. Enjoy!
