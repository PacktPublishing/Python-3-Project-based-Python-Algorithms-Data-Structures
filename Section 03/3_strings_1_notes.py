"Hello world using double quotes"
"""Hello world using
triple quotes, also known as
multi-line strings"""

# To print an object to the screen, use the print function
print('Hello world') # This will print Hello World in the terminal

# To use an apostrophe ' in your print statement, wrap your
# string in double quotes like below
print("I'm using an apostrophe in this statement")

# To use quotes within your statement, wrap your string in
# single quotes like below
print('This is a "quote from a book" which I like')

# Variables are used to reference objects in Python, think
# of variables as memory addresses. They should be named
# using snake case

# You can use them in your print function to print to the screen
print(message)
print(name)

# We can combine strings and print them out using the print function
# the comma will automatically result in a space in-between the
