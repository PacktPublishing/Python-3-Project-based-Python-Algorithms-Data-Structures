E-book

I built an e-book which covers the content from the introductory "Python
in-depth" section of this course. This book can be used in conjunction with the
section (recommended for beginners) or by itself (if you have some prior
experience). There are text notes with each video lecture in the course as well,
so usage of this book is fully optional and not required.

Feel free to download a copy for yourself. There are two versions available for
your convenience - html and pdf.

Book chapters: Command Line basics, Strings, Print formatting, Numbers,
Branching (if/elif/else blocks), Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, For loops and
Generators, While loops, Functions and Classes.
